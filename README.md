H Co. Munitions is a WIP mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights that adds a way to bulk craft factory-grade ammunition

This mod aims to enable automated, bulk crafting of factory-grade ammunition, through the production of powder, primer, cores and casings.
I'm hoping to accomplish this through the following additions:

- Several machines from H Co.
  1. Draw Press : for making casings of various calibers
  2. Bullet Assembly : shapes lead and copper into bullets
  3. Priming Press : for making primers
  4. Powder Turret : produces and loads modern smokeless powder into rounds. Also the final machine in the assembly line

+++ THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN [REDACTED] EITHER BECAUSE I DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE TIME, THE SKILLS, OR THE PATIENCE. +++

- Each machine is capable of being: 
  1. crafted : as an unusable item
  2. built : as usable furniture
  3. installed : as usuable furniture
  4. deconstructed : either into a "compacted" item version or into the original parts

- Interacting with each machine should allow:
  1. loading of materials
  2. initiation of manufacture process
  3. unloading of finished products
